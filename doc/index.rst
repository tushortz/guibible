Getting started with GuiBible
=============================

:Author:   **Taiwo Kareem**

This is a simple bible application that parses bible verses and either prints it to the console window or displays it graphically **(Pygame needed in this case)**.

It has one module called ``net`` which handles the NET version of the bible.


Requirements
------------
* Python 3
* Pygame (For graphical display)
 

 **To install pygame, use:** 

.. code:: python

    pip install pygame


Installation
------------

`PIP`
^^^^^
If you have **Pip** installed, go to the ``terminal window`` and type 

.. code:: python
    
    pip install guibible

`Manually`
^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the `Python Packaging Index <https://pypi.python.org>`_ website. Search for `guibible <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guibible>`_ and either download the *compressed version* for your operating system and copy it into the ``Lib`` --> ``site-packages`` directory of your ``python 3``. 


You can also download and run the ``.msi`` or ``.exe`` file for windows.
