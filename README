This is a simple bible application that parses bible verses and either prints it to the console window or displays it graphically **(Pygame needed in this case)**. 


Requirements
------------
* Python 3
* Pygame (For graphical display)
 

 **To install pygame, use:** 

.. code:: python

    pip install pygame


Installation
------------

`PIP`
^^^^^
If you have **Pip** installed, go to the ``terminal window`` and type 

.. code:: python
    
    pip install guibible

`Manually`
^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the `Python Packaging Index <https://pypi.python.org>`_ website. Search for `guibible <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guibible>`_ and either download the *compressed version* for your operating system and copy it into the ``Lib`` --> ``site-packages`` directory of your ``python 3``. 

|

You can also download and run the ``.msi`` or ``.exe`` file for windows.


Usage Instructions
------------------

Importing
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    from guibible.net import Bible   # or 
    import guibible.net


Usage
^^^^^

**All are Optional arguments**

``instance_variable = Bible(book, chapter, verse_begin, verse_end)``

.. note::
    If you imported it the first way, you would have to use it this way. 
    
    
    ``Default is Bible(Genesis, 1) which shows Genesis 1``

    .. code-block:: python
    
        sample= Bible("John", 3, 16, 18) # Will get John 3:16-18

    Otherwise use:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        sample = guibible.net.Bible("John", 3, 16)

|

**To display(print) verse in console window, use:**

* `No arguments` --> sample.read() 

**To display verse in graphical format, use:**

* `No arguments` --> ``sample.display()`` will use the default foreground color (black) on the default background color (white).

* `One argument` --> ``sample.display((0,0,255))`` will use the `first argument(supplied foreground color)` on the default background color (white).
    
* `Two arguments` --> ``sample.display((0,0,255), (255, 255, 0))`` will use the `first argument(supplied foreground color)` on the second argument (supplied background color).


.. note:: 
    
    See `documentation <http://www.pythonhosted.org/guibible/>`_ for full information


Quitting
^^^^^^^^

You can quit the pygame graphical window by either pressing the ``Q``, ``SPACE`` or ``ESC`` key on the keyboard
